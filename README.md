# Stock Market Regret Calculator
How much money could you have made on the stock market? This stock market regret calculator will determine exactly how much money you would have today if you invested into a company on a specific date!

## How it works

The user inputs their preferred stock, date, and investment amount. We have preloaded in a common stock, date, and investment amount, although those can all be easily changed. By hitting the 'Add' button, the user loads that data in to be evaluated. When they hit the 'Calculate' button, that data will be calculated using the AlphaVantage API, and the results will appear below, allowing the user to feel their regret mount.
